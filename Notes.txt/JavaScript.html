        <h1>What is JavaScript?</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>JavaScript is a programming language used to make websites interactive.</li>
            <li>It allows you to create dynamic content like buttons, animations, and forms.</li>
            <li>It's widely used in web development and is easy to learn.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>What is the History of JavaScript?</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 while he was working at Netscape.</li>
            <li>It was initially called LiveScript but later renamed JavaScript.</li>
            <li>It is mainly used as a scripting language in web browsers, where it interacts with web pages, though it
                doesn't handle input <br>
                or output directly.</li>
            <li>The browser provides the tools for interacting with the outside world.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>JavaScript Versions:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>ES1 (1997):</strong> First official version of JavaScript, standardized as ECMAScript.</li>
            <li><strong>ES3 (1999):</strong> Added regular expressions, try/catch for error handling, and better string
                manipulation.</li>
            <li><strong>ES5 (2009):</strong> Introduced "strict mode," JSON support, Array methods (forEach, map,
                filter), and more.</li>
            <li><strong>ES6 (2015):</strong> A significant update, introducing let/const, arrow functions, classes,
                promises, template literals, and modules.</li>
            <li><strong>ES7 (2016):</strong> Added Array.prototype.includes and the exponentiation operator (**).</li>
            <li><strong>ES8 (2017):</strong> Introduced async/await, Object.entries, and Object.values.</li>
            <li><strong>ES9 (2018):</strong> Added features like rest/spread properties for objects and asynchronous
                iteration.</li>
            <li><strong>ES10 (2019):</strong> Added flat(), flatMap(), optional catch binding, and more.</li>
            <li><strong>ES11 (2020):</strong> Introduced dynamic import, nullish coalescing (??), optional chaining
                (?.), and BigInt.</li>
            <li><strong>ES12 (2021):</strong> Brought new features like replaceAll() for strings, and numeric
                separators.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>Features of JavaScript:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Supported by all web browsers:</strong> Every major web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
                can run JavaScript because it has built-in tools for it.</li>
            <li><strong>Similar to C language:</strong> JavaScript's structure and rules are similar to the C
                programming language, making it an organized language.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexible with data types:</strong> JavaScript is a "weakly typed" language, which means it can
                automatically change the type of data based on what you’re doing.</li>
            <li><strong>Object-oriented but different:</strong> JavaScript is object-oriented, but it uses prototypes
                instead of traditional classes for inheritance.</li>
            <li><strong>Light and fast:</strong> It's a lightweight language and runs immediately without needing to be
                compiled.</li>
            <li><strong>Case-sensitive:</strong> Uppercase and lowercase letters matter in JavaScript, so <em>name</em>
                and <em>Name</em> would be treated as different things.</li>
            <li><strong>Works on many operating systems:</strong> JavaScript runs smoothly on various systems like
                Windows, macOS, and others.</li>
            <li><strong>Gives control over the browser:</strong> It allows users to interact with web browsers easily
                (like opening pop-ups or changing what’s displayed on the screen).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h1>Applications of JavaScript</h1>
        <p>JavaScript is used to make websites interactive. It can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Check user input:</strong> Like making sure a form is filled correctly.</li>
            <li><strong>Create dynamic menus:</strong> Menus that change on the fly.</li>
            <li><strong>Show the current date and time:</strong> Displaying real-time information.</li>
            <li><strong>Display pop-ups and dialog boxes:</strong> Such as alerts, confirmations, or prompts.</li>
            <li><strong>Create clocks and other real-time displays:</strong> For tracking time and updating content in
                real time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>How to Add JavaScript in HTML Document?</h1>
        <p>To add JavaScript to an HTML document, you can use a few methods. You can either write JavaScript directly in the HTML 
            <br>file or link to an external JavaScript file.</p>
        <h2>Inline JavaScript</h2>
        <p>We can write JavaScript code directly inside the HTML element using the onclick, onmouseover, or other event handler attributes.</p>
            <button onclick="alert('This is the demo of Button using JS')">
                Click Here
            </button>
            <button onclick="alert('Button Demo')">
                Demo
            </button>
        <h2>Internal JavaScript (Within script Tag)</h2>    
        <p>We can write JavaScript code inside the script tag within the HTML file. 
            <br> This is known as internal JavaScript and is commonly placed inside the head or body section of the HTML document.</p>
        <h3>1. JavaScript Code Inside head Tag</h3>    
        <p>Placing JavaScript within the head section of an HTML document ensures that the script is <br>
            loaded and executed as the page loads. This is useful for scripts that need to be initialized before the page content is rendered.</p>
        <h3>2. JavaScript Code Inside body Tag</h3>
        <p>JavaScript can be added inside the body section of an HTML page. It's common to place it at <br>
             the end of the body so that the content of the page loads first. This is helpful if the script <br>
                needs the whole page to be loaded before it runs.</p>
        <h2>External JavaScript (Using External File)</h2>
        <p>For bigger projects or when you want to use the same script in multiple HTML files, you can put your 
            <br>JavaScript code in a separate .js file. You then connect this file to your HTML document by using the src attribute inside a scripts tag.</p>

        <h1>JavaScript Syntax</h1>
        <p>
            JavaScript syntax is the set of rules that defines how to write and structure JavaScript code. It includes things like statements, 
            <br>variables, functions, operators, and how to control the flow of a program.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <button type="button" onclick="myfun()">
            Fun Demo
        </button>
    </div>
